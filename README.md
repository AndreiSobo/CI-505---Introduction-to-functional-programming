# CI-505---Introduction-to-functional-programming


This repository contains a few files that demonstrate functional programming in Java. The files are written using Java 9 and cover the following topics:

- Lambda expressions
- Method references
- Streams
- Functional interfaces
- Getting Started
To get started with functional programming in Java it's advised to have an IDE, although a text editor or a browser-based IDE can work just fine. I used VS Code and IntelliJ Idea.

To use the files in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the files in Eclipse. You can then run the files to see how functional programming works in Java.
